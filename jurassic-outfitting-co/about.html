                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1980, our company's founders Taha Shahid and Mike Howell started creating custom
                    clothes and gear for close friends, family, and coworkers to finance as well as support
                    their outdoor activities. Word spread about the well-crafted custom products to
                    professional outdoors-men, leading our founders to realize that the market lacked
                    products catered to professionals, instead focusing on providing stylish products to the
                    general public that lacked functionality. After this realization, Taha and Michael
                    became well-known throughout the world for their incredibly functional gear. When the
                    construction of Jurassic Park began in 1987, the owner of the park, John Hammond,
                    reached out to our founders about an opportunity to create an outfitting business for
                    the park. Working closely with Hammond and REXpeditions, our founders
                    dedicated themselves to creating a business that would ensure park visitors were fully
                    equipped during their expeditions.

                <h3>Taha Shahid</h3>
                <p>I was 40 years old and dreaded my life behind a computer screen all day as a web developer,
                    but I found happiness in the hiking, safaris, and other outdoor activities Michael dragged
                    me along on. As the man who deals with all of the software, I love nothing more than
                    creating a smooth online experience for our customers.

                <p>My grandma first taught me how to design and build clothes when I was in elementary school,
                    and I have applied that knowledge to the outdoor life my father introduced me to ever since
                    I was young. Taha&#8217;s business and online expertise let me do what I like best &mdash; creating
                    functional clothing and gear that leave customers from around the world satisfied.</p>
