                            <p>
                                In 1980, our company's founders Taha Shahid and Mike Howell started creating custom
                                clothes and gear for close friends, family, and coworkers to finance as well as support
                                their outdoor activities. Word spread about the well-crafted custom products to
                                professional outdoors-men, leading our founders to realize that the market lacked
                                products catered to professionals, instead focusing on providing stylish products to the
                                general public that lacked functionality. After this realization, Taha and Michael
                                became well-known throughout the world for their incredibly functional gear. When the
                                construction of Jurassic Park began in 1987, the owner of the park, John Hammond,
                                reached out to our founders about an opportunity to create an outfitting business for
                                the park. Working closely with Hammond and Jurassic Adventure Tours, our founders
                                dedicated themselves to creating a business that would ensure park visitors were fully
                                equipped during their expeditions.
