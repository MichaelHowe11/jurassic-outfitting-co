            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Waterproof and Breathable Materials: Outdoor boots designed for various activities like hiking or camping often feature waterproof and breathable materials. These materials, such as Gore-Tex or other waterproof membranes, help keep the feet dry by preventing water from entering the boots while allowing moisture and perspiration to escape. This feature is crucial for maintaining comfort during extended outdoor activities in different weather conditions.</li>
                <li>Traction and Grip: The outsole of outdoor boots is a critical feature for providing traction and grip on various surfaces. Quality outdoor boots typically have rubber outsoles with deep lugs or treads to enhance stability and prevent slipping, especially on uneven terrain, rocks, or slippery surfaces. The design of the outsole is often tailored to the specific demands of the outdoor activity, whether it's hiking, trekking, or mountaineering.</li>
                <li>Ankle Support and Stability: Outdoor boots often come in different styles, including low-cut, mid-cut, and high-cut options. High-cut boots, which cover the ankle, provide additional support and stability, making them suitable for rugged terrain and activities that involve carrying a heavier load. Proper ankle support helps reduce the risk of ankle injuries and provides extra stability when navigating challenging outdoor environments.</li>
