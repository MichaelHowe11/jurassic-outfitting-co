            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Brightness and Light Output: The brightness of a headlamp is a crucial feature and is often measured in lumens. Lumens indicate the total amount of visible light emitted by the headlamp. Different activities may require varying levels of brightness. For example, reading a map in the dark might require fewer lumens than hiking on a trail. Adjustable brightness settings or a range of light modes (e.g., high, medium, low, and strobe) can enhance the versatility of the headlamp.</li>
                <li>Battery Life and Power Source: The battery life of a headlamp is essential, especially for outdoor activities where access to power sources may be limited. Headlamps may use disposable batteries (e.g., AAA or AA) or rechargeable batteries. Some models also come with a USB-rechargeable feature, allowing users to charge the headlamp with a power bank or other USB-compatible devices. Consider the expected runtime and the convenience of the power source based on your intended use.</li>
                <li>Adjustability and Comfort: A headlamp should be comfortable to wear for extended periods. Look for features such as adjustable straps and a lightweight design. The ability to tilt or swivel the lamp housing is crucial for directing light where needed, especially when performing tasks like reading or working on intricate projects. Comfortable headbands and padding can make a significant difference in user experience, especially during activities that require prolonged use of the headlamp.</li>
